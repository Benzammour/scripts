# scripts

These are all of my scripts that I use on a regular basis to ease task in my everyday life.

## Index

- `lecturedl`: enables you to download a complete lecture by supplying the appropriate url (RWTH lectures only)
- `scs`: this tool enables me to create a screenshot of a rectangular region from the dmenu, and copy it into my clipboard.
- `trackpoint-toggle`: this enables me to dis-/enable the trackpoint bullet of my thinkpad (with a key combination mapped to this script).
